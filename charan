You’re getting:

! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/charanpingula/git-intro.git'


This means your local repository and remote repository (on GitHub) are out of sync — GitHub has some commits (like a README or .gitignore) that you don’t have locally.

Git prevents you from overwriting those remote changes accidentally.
